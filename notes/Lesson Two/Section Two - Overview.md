# Notes for Secion Two

## Course Outline
* Databases and SQL
    * Gain a general understanding of databases, their purprose and use cases for different types and structures. 
    * This course uses Postgres, a relational database, so we will spend the majority of the lesson learning more about Postgres
    * There will also be experimenting with some of the most common and useful SQL commands and concepts.

* API with Postgres
	* Learn all the ins and outs of creating a Node API backed by a Postgres database. 
	* This lesson includes concepts and practices you are likely to use every day in a web development or software engineering job.
	* Some examples are database migrations, environment variables, and integration testing,

* REST API with Express
	* To complete the API, the focus is to use the client-facing Express logic. 
	* We will cover what it means to create a RESTful API and you will learn good practices for clean code architecture in a Node application. 
	* It also covers important concepts like CORS and Express middleware.

* Authentication and Security in a Node API
	* Password hashing, salt and pepper, JWTs, and more - this lesson is all about data security and authentication. 
	* You will be introduced to the best industry standard libraries for these security measures and pick up some good habits along the way.

* SQL for advanced API functionality
	* In the last lesson we pick up right where we left off with SQL and learn queries and database concepts to extend our API in powerful ways. 
	* It'll cover joins and database relationships, and use them to create new concepts in our API like cart functionality.
	* It will also cover how to create dashboard endpoints filled with useful information.


## Lesson Topics
* Different kinds of databases and what they're for
* Relational Database structure, queries, and common commands
* Relational Database joins
* Database migrations
* CRUD for Node models
* REST structure for Express Endpoints
* CORS enabled API
* API Testing
* Password hashing for security
* JWT's for authentication and protected endpoints

## Lesson GOALS
* Create a RESTful Node API with Express
* Write SQL queries for Postgres to power an API
* Design a clean Node API with well organized logic, full test coverage, and database management through migrations


> Great job! Relational is for structured data and no-SQL can store data in documents, as well as many other structures
